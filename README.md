ATZSwitch
=========

ATZSwitch is an iOS 5+ friendly UIControl that mimics the style of the iOS 7 UISwitch.

Simply #import ATZSwitch.h into your project and you can use it in almost the exact same way as UISwitch. ATZSwitch can be used in Interface Builder as well.

Particilar attention was paid to making the animations of the switch nearly identical to the animations of the standard iOS7 switch. Especially the border animation and thumb "bounce" animation.

ATZSwitch has 3 UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR identified methods that will customize the stlye of the switch: onTintColor, thumbTintColor, and borderColor.

What It Doesn't Do
------------------

At this point images cannot be set for the thumb or track.
