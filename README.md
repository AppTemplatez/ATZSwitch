=========

ATZSwitch is an iOS5+ friendly UIControl that mimics the style of the iOS7 UISwitch.

Particilar attention was paid to making the animations of the switch nearly identical to the animations of the standard iOS7 switch. Especially the border animation and thumb "bounce" animation.

ATZSwitch has 3 UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR identified methods that will customize the stlye of the switch: onTintColor, thumbTintColor, and borderColor.

At this point images cannot be set for the thumb or track.
